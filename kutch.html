        Kutch is an erstwhile princely state of India holding onto its grandeur nature from the past. Kutch is probably one of the
        most beautiful, yet surreal places in India with the vast expanses of the white salt desert.  The place comes to life during
        the winters when the Rann Festival is held during December-February everywhere in which there are huge camp settlements with
        cultural programs, functions and adventure activities like hot-air ballooning. Kutch is also among the largest district of 
        India with a terribly low population density.
