        Situated amidst lush green, forested hills on the highest peak in the Aravali range, Mount Abu is the summer capital for
        the Indian state of Rajasthan. Its cool and soothing climate makes it an ideal retreat. Explore a number of Jain temples, 
        including the Dilwara Temples, a complex carved of while marble, or visit the nearby Achalgarh fort, which houses many beautiful
        temples of its own.
